	<h2>KTM Duke 390 (2016) long term review</h2>
	    <p class="quote">
		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Torque - makes it a breeze to oovertake in the highways and razor sharp in the track carves the corners like a butter knife.</li>
			<li>Lightweight - This nature make a very nimble and handling machine.</li>
			<li>Power- The summing up of the above characteristic's with 44hp gives this motorcycle a good power to weight ratio.(close to 292bhp/tonne)
			<li>Chasis is light and solid.</li>
			<li>Suspension is top notch for this range and keeps up planted on the tarmac</li>
			<li>Tyres- Metzeller they perform really good on track and off the track it's quite scary to ride in muddy highway's(INDIA).I'd recommend Michelin Pilot Street Radials.(it's also kinder by the pocket) </li><br>


	    <h3>Cons</h3>
	        <li>Heating- I personally find it hard to ride in stop go traffic because of this my legs would be firing.This won't be an issue if you ride it in highway's.</li>
	        <li>light-it's average at the best. I uprgaded my lights to "Philip's extreme vision plus".</li>
	        <li>seats-They are not made for touring but not a big down'er.</li><br>
	    </p>

	    <h3>General</h3>
           <p>After completing nearly 35,000 KM i think i can share my experience with my fellow rider's.This is a extremely capable both on roads and track.The dirtbike engine on a sportbike is a hit or miss as it doesnt have the refinement or the high revving nature of Japans or German's but it really makes up for it in it's explosive midrange.</p>
           <p>This is quite compact in dimensions so a person more than 5ft11 may not be very comfortable.</p>
           <p>The service is quite easy on the pocket as well due to KTM's localisation it has paid for us customer's it's cheaper to maintain.The spares are also much cheaper when compared to the japanese twins Honda and Kawis.We get a premium service as expected.</p>
           <p>To end this review as of india this motorcycle gives a bang for buck and a run for the mid range motorcycles.Ride Safe</p>
